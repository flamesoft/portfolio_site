- line: I grew up in China and always dreamed to see the world some day. So I came to Sweden to study a master programme in KTH (KTH Royal Institute of Technology) 2002. Then studied in Chalmers University and settled down in Gothenburg afterwards. I still want to escape from this rainy city and live somewhere else.

- line: I have worked with native mobile Apps since 2012. Before this, I have developed Windows applications for 10+ years. Programming is still attractive to me like sweet cookies. But it is also like baking, you need to test and then it works. Patience is important in this career.

- line: Programming, running my own company, high-tech gadgets, painting, making organic lip balms. But I spend so much time in my work that I have less time for other hobbies. Priority is important and difficult. But I am trying to work less and enjoy more time with my family.
